## Welcome to Wombat

We are creating an OpenFisca instance for Canada's COVID-19 benefits.

### What we're working on

Our OpenFisca instance (API) is at [https://openfisca-canada.herokuapp.com](https://openfisca-canada.herokuapp.com)

The rules (policies, laws, etc) can be browsed at [https://canada-rules.herokuapp.com](https://canada-rules.herokuapp.com)

Swagger docs are available for you to consume our API: [https://canada-rules.herokuapp.com/swagger](https://canada-rules.herokuapp.com/swagger)

Our demo (prototype) app will be at [http://wombatwombat.github.io/biscuits/](http://wombatwombat.github.io/biscuits/)

### Contributing

This is an open source volunteer project. If you'd like to contribute, our work is on GitHub, pull requests welcome.

We're making 2 things:
 1. An openfisca instance - [OpenFisca-Canada](https://github.com/wombatwombat/OpenFisca-Canada)
2. A demo front-end for testing that - [biscuits](https://github.com/wombatwombat/biscuits)

We're using [OpenFisca](http://openfisca.org), a legislation-as-code platform, and the [canada.ca design system](https://design.canada.ca)
