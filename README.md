## Welcome to Wombat

We are creating an OpenFisca instance for Canada's COVID-19 benefits.

### Contributing

This is an open source volunteer project. If you'd like to contribute, our work is on GitHub, pull requests welcome.

We're making 2 things:
 1. An openfisca instance - [OpenFisca-Canada](https://github.com/wombatwombat/OpenFisca-Canada)
2. A demo front-end for testing that - [biscuits](https://github.com/wombatwombat/biscuits)

We're using [OpenFisca](http://openfisca.org), a legislation-as-code platform, and the [canada.ca design system](https://design.canada.ca)
